Branding;
The concept of branding can be complex for many because people usually think it is just advertising. Though branding and advertising are both part of marketing,Â 
Branding is more about how people think or feel about you or your company when they hear or see your name.
Advertising on the other hand is simply a means to communicate what you are offering through mediums such as radio, flyers, etc.
